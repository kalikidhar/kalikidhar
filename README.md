- 👋 Hi, I’m @kalikidhar , just another master procrastinator , trying to understand the intricacies of Computer Science and failing miserably at it :p
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning . I like to tell creative stories with data and try to design and build sytems that are able to learn from data.
- 🌱 I’m currently watching some shows on   <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Netflix-E50914?style=for-the-badge&logo=netflix&logoColor=white"/>   . I am interested to know more about the Time Series Transformer and learning some Web Development , I have recently fallen in love with Vue.js due to it's simplicity and ability to easily integrate with other technologies . 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate and work on some fun projects .
- ⚡ Fun fact: Absolutely Nothing . Stodgy + Boring .
